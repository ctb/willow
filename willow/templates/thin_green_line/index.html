						<h1>Hello!</h1>
						
						<p>
						
									And so we have the (almost) obligatory side bar column thing. Here you can put absolutely any thing you want! Great huh? Yep.
						
						</p>
						
						<h1>Animated Gifs</h1>
						
						<p>
						
									Aren't <a href="images/backgrounds/menu_a_hover.gif">animated gifs</a> great!!! Often considered to be one of the biggest design no-no's out there. But, if you know me then you know I like to take a bad thing and make it good. While animation in web design itself is off putting (for me at least), I think that small animations like the menu on this site help accentuate certain features and also add some 'cool' factor to a site. Well, that's what I think...

								Hello and welcome to "Thin Green Line" another template by me! Anyone who knows me by now will know that I love plain templates which offer a lot of whitespace and maybe one or two features which make it stand out. In this template, that feature would be the use of animated gifs. Sure, they're regarded as horrible things but I think they can be used quite nicely, as I have tried to demonstrate in this template.
						
						</p>
						
						<p>
						
								A note on the slogan in the header: The gap between the grey line and the slogan is adjusted in the css. If your site title is longer than "Thin Green Line" then you may have to adjust this value!
						
						</p>
						
						
						
						<h1><a href="#" id="css"></a>CSS &amp; XHTML</h1>
						
						<p>
						
								As you would expect, this web site makes use of css for its entire layout. No nasty tables here baby! The markup is also valid XHTML 1.1 strict. CSS &amp; XHTML are important for the following reasons:
						
						</p>

						
						<ul>
						
								<li>Accessibility. Big subject. Read more <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">here</a>.</li>
								<li>Keeping file sizes small</li>
								<li>Search Engine Optimisation</li>
								<li>Loads more</li>
						
						</ul>

						
						<p>
						
								Anyway, this site validates as both <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">CSS</a> and <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">XHTML 1.1 Strict</a> compliant. Which is nice.
